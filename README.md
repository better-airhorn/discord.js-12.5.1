### fork of discord.js
\
Better Airhorn still runs on the very old discord.js version 12.5.1 because I have lost interest in discord bots for a while.
12.5.1 recently became unusable, which was expected as it is not supported since a long time, because voice channels now have own text channels, which crashes it.

I'm unwilling to make the needed changes for 13.x because the Bot itself is only supposed to run for 1 Week, after that it is no longer needed. Spending multiple hours for updating to 13.x just to dump it a week later is not worth it.

Do not use as this is only a temporary ugly fix
